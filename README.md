Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!

I’m Ibrahim Ben Daya, a Machine Learning Specialist with over 8 years of diverse experience spanning industry, academia, and research. In my most recent role at General Motors, I contributed to AI-driven innovations including NLP-based quality tools, computer vision systems, reinforcement learning for personalization, and data analytics for marketing optimization. Before that I was a PhD student at the University of Waterloo, where my research focused on developing a Conditional Random Field-based ultrasound imaging system, pushing the boundaries of medical imaging technologies. During my doctoral studies, I gained valuable industry insights through internships at Continental Automotive, researched adversarial attacks and defenses on neural networks, and Christie Digital, contributing to cutting-edge display technologies.

While my industrial projects are proprietary, this repository showcases personal and learning projects that reflect my passion for data science, machine learning, and software development. These projects often merge my technical expertise with creative applications inspired by hobbies like D&D and Fantasy Premier League. I am also using this space to explore topics I haven’t had the opportunity to work on in industry yet, such as understanding large language models (LLMs) and analyzing time-series data.
