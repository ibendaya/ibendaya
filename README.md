Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!

I’m Ibrahim Ben Daya, a Machine Learning Specialist with over 8 years of diverse experience spanning industry, academia, and research.

While my industrial projects are proprietary, this repository showcases personal and learning projects that reflect my passion for data science, machine learning, and software development. These projects often merge my technical expertise with creative applications inspired by hobbies like D&D and Fantasy Premier League. I am also using this space to explore topics I haven’t had the opportunity to work on in industry yet, such as understanding large language models (LLMs) and analyzing time-series data.
